I am from San Francisco and have a politics BA from UC Santa Cruz. In the past
I worked in food service (Ike's Place, Marianne's Ice Cream) and a number of
political jobs (voter registration, city council staff, polling, petitioning).
In 2013, I began to study web development and programming. I followed online curriculums such as the [Odin project](http://theodinproject.com/), took three months of remote classes at [Code Union](http://codeunion.io), and attended three months of full-time classes at [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/curriculum).

I'm currently working in the field of HR analytics at [Atipica](http://atipica.co).
Previously I was at the photo-sharing social networks [Sobrr](http://sobrr.life) and
[Timeset](http://timeset.com).

I am fan of fast and / or experimental music, and play the drums. I enjoy making
electronic music and mashups, and aim to eventually be a DIY producer. Other
interests of mine include sharing economies, internet sociology, direct democracy,
pinball, hiking, and aquariums.
