I got a Politics BA from UC Santa Cruz in 2013 and started programming right
afterwards. I previously did a lot of public-outreach type work like voter
registration, city council intern, polling, petitioning, etc.

To learn to code I utilized free online resources as well as courses through
[CodeUnion](http://codeunion.io) and [App Academy](http://appacademy.io).

For the past few years, I've been working as a mostly-backend Rails developer for 
startups here in the Bay Area. I'm a big fan of Ruby but would also welcome 
opportunities to employ other tools like Node, Coffeescript, or Elixir.

Here's where my roles have been:

- [Atipica](http://atipica.co) HR analytics
- [Timeset](http://timeset.com) Social network for travelers
- [Sobrr](http://sobrr.life) Social network with ephemeral content
