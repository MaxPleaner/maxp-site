went to UCSC in 2008.

Was undeclared for first two years.
Took linguistics classes in my third year.
Switched to Politics and finished with a Politics B.A.

I switched to politics after travelling to Israel and Palestine,
I'd also held political jobs since 2008.

After finishing this degree, I returned to my hometown SF and decided to start programming. I'd become confident with independent and intensive study from the  experience of the Politics degree, and was eager to take advantage of self-paced curriculum and 'bootcamps'.

I used curriculum like the Odin Project,
attended CodeUnion's 3-month course
and App Academy's 3-month intensive 'bootcamp'.

Since then I've been working and studying online.

I'm constantly learning.
