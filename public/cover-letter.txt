GfyCat team, 

My name's Max, I'm a programmer from San Francisco.

I got a politics BA in 2013 and had worked a number of jobs
in that field. In 2013 I returned to San Francisco and saw that programming was a field which rewarded self-learners. Over the next two years, I studied online and attended CodeUnion and App Academy's classes. My last two positions have been as a JSON API / Rails backend developer at small startups.

At Sobrr.life, I built a single-page admin interface, implemented a promo page's redesign, migrated data, added features with tests, and used Redis to build a data cache and a queue-based mobile notification system. 

At Timeset, I was the lead backend developer and built the photo-sharing social network's core API with AWS deployment. Features including photo-resizing, LRU cache, worker/staging servers, admin interfaces, automated tests, geolocation, and mobile notifications.

I've been recently learning about websockets and wrote a Rails gem
for scaffolding realtime apps. I also have experience with the following tools:

Meteor, Sinatra, jQuery, SQL, RSpec, Mechanize, Git, Heroku,
AJAX, Linux, Backbone.js, React, YAML, SSL, Airbrake, Email,
RSS, oAuth

I'm looking to continue to expand my range of expertise and to collaborate with a team on difficult problems. I'd look forward to speaking more. 

Thanks,
Max
