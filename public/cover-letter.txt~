Hello, I'm Max Pleaner.

I'm from San Francisco and from 2007-2013, worked in politics roles both here and in Santa Cruz, where I obtained a Politics B.A. degree. Since 2013 I've been programming with web technology. I've been working as a Ruby on Rails + JSON + AWS API and backend developer for mobile startups, including being the lead backend developer at Timeset.

I'm relentlessly learning and have strong generalist skills in full-stack development. I enjoy writing a wide facet of features, from automated tests to realtime web apps. I'm interested in collaborating with a driven team and creating successful, innovative products.

Take a look at my resume to see some things I've built (maxpleaner.com/resume).

Here's a list of some tools I've used:

Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, Cuba, Resque, RSpec, Selenium, Javscript, jQuery(UI),Backbone, Underscore, Coffeescript, Node, NPM, Jasmine, Gulp, Browserify, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap, Git, C++, Airbrake, Virtualbox, popular APIs, Heroku, AWS (SES, S3, SQS, EB, RDS, ElasticCache, EC2), Linux, Bash, Servers (Passenger, Unicorn, Puma, Nginx), Templating (ERB, Handlebars, Mustache, Markdown, HAML), NoSQL (Firebase, Redis), SQL (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL), Realtime (Socket.io, websockets), Serialization (YAML, JSON)

Thanks for your consideration and hope to speak further.

Sincerely, Max
