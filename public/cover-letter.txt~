Hello, my name's Max Pleaner.

Since 2013 I've been programming with web technology. I've been working as a Ruby on Rails + JSON + AWS API and backend developer for mobile startups, including being the lead backend developer at Timeset.

I'm from San Francisco and from 2007-2013, worked in politics roles both here and in Santa Cruz, where I obtained a Politics B.A. degree.

I'm relentlessly learning and have strong generalist skills in full-stack development. I enjoy writing a wide facet of features, from automated tests to realtime web apps. I'm interested in collaborating with a driven team and creating successful, innovative products.

My portfolio projects are listed on my website:
