now deployed at [maxp-site.heroku.com](maxp-site.heroku.com)

See app/assets/javascripts/application.js for the single-page-app stuff.

The rails app is mostly empty, as there is no dynamic content.

Pretty much all of the html lives in app/views/pages/index.html.erb.

There is also some style in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss.
